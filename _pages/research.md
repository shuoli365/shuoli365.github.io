## Overview

Continuously driven by emerging internet-of-things (IoT) applications, such as wireless sensor networks, wearable electronics, robotics, and human-machine interfaces, the next-generation IoT devices need to further enhance their capabilities by improving: 1) energy efficiency to achieve an optimum energy-performance tradeoff under resource-constrained conditions; 2) edge intelligence for evolving from passive components to smart systems with inference and interaction capabilities; 3) autonomy and miniaturization for ubiquitous deployment and operation without any human intervention.

Inspired by this vision, my current research areas include analog/digital/mixed-signal integrated circuits, energy harvesting and power management units, in-memory computing for edge AI, and systems-on-chip for ultra-low power IoT systems. My research mission is to make the next-generation IoT devices more energy-efficient, intelligent, and miniaturized to enable ubiquitous and autonomous deployment by leveraging advanced integrated circuit techniques with system optimizations from both power delivery and edge computing perspectives.
