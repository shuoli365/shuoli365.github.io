## Overview

 Driven by emerging IoT applications, such as wireless sensor networks, wearable electronics,human-machine interfaces, and robotics, the next-generation IoT devices need to furtherenhance their capabilities by improving: 1) energy effi ciency to tradeoff the performance and power consumption under resource-constrained conditions; 2) intelligence for evolving frompassive components to smart systems with inference and interactiocapabilities; 3) autonomyand miniaturization for ubiquitous deployment and operation without any human intervention;4) agile design methodology to reduce the design complexity, time-to-market, labor cost, andrisks.
 
Inspired by this vision, my current research areas include energy harvesting and powermanagement units, in-memory computing accelerators and architectures for machine-learningapplications, and systems-on-chip for ultra-low power IoT platforms. My research aims to makethe next-generation IoT devices more energy-effi cient, intelligent, and miniaturized to enableubiquitous and autonomous deployment by leveraging advanced integrated circuit techniqueswith cross-layer optimizations at application, algorithm, architecture, circuit, and designautomation levels.
